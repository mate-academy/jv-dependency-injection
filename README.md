# jv-dependency-injection

This is a simple file parser project.
In this project you can find three interfaces with their implementations.

Your task is to implement an injector that uses `@Component` and `@Inject` annotations to initialize and return 
Object instances. Convention is to use `Component` on the classes that are used for instance creation (usually these are interface implementations)
and `Inject` to mark fields that need to be initialized. If `Component` annotation is missing above the class, we shouldn't be able to create an instance of this class in Injector, and we should throw an exception <br>
NOTE: Pay attention to annotation's visibility when you want to use it with reflection API,
`@Retention` property may help you to configure it.
