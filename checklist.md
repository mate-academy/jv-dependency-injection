## Common mistakes (jv-dependency-injection)

* Don't forget about informative variable names.
* You should use only `@Component` and `@Inject` annotations.
* Do not forget to add `@Target` to custom annotations.
* Don't forget about annotations checks in your Injector class.
* Let's check instances map before new instance creation.
* Make Interface Implementations map a class field. You can fill it in using `Map.of()`.  
* When throwing an exception add an informative message to it. Also, don't forget to 
* add an exception you're catching in `catch` block to the `RuntimeException` object you throw

Bad example:
```java
} catch(Exception e) {
  throw new SomeException("Can't initialize object with Injector");
}
```
Good example:
```java
} catch(Exception e) {
  throw new SomeException("Injection failed, missing @Component annotaion on the class " + someInfoAboutClass, e);
}
```
* It is better to replace many exceptions that have a common parent with a general parental exception.

Bad example:
```java
} catch (InvocationTargetException | InstantiationException
        | IllegalAccessException | NoSuchMethodException e) {
```
Good example:
```java
} catch (ReflectiveOperationException e) {
```
